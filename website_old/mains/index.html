            <h1>Motivation</h1>
            <p>
              In 2022, Elouen, the creator of GreenSloth, wrote his Bachelor thesis about comparing the popular steady-state and simple Farquhar, von Caemmerer, and Berry Model (FvCB model) and a kinetic photosynthesis model. While searching for the other model, he searched various public sources for scientific literature and tried to recreate several models. During this time, he arrived at one conclusion: modeling, especially photosynthesis, is aimed to help others understand more of the essential process of life on Earth, but the scientific community has not achieved a common way to share their models. This is where the idea of GreenSloth first came into play.
            </p>
            <p>
              Elouen and the maintainers' idea and goal for GreenSloth is simple: Create a database of popular kinetic photosynthesis models to make access to them as easy as possible â€” even a Sloth could do it! GreenSloth can be separated into three essential parts of finding models: Searching, Summary, and Comparison.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are facilitating the search for models by collecting many popular ones and listing them for you. To make finding the correct model easier, we created categories of models that can be chosen via tags. With these simple aspects, we can easily translate the hours of literature search typically done to find the model you need into a few minutes. It also gives you a broader scope of how some models are similar.
            </p>
            <p>
              With our curated summaries, we shorten the aspect of getting to know the model. With these summaries, we hope to enlighten you on what the model consists of to make it easier to decide if this model is for you. Additionally, we have also tabularized some information on the models that are commonly used as a basis to describe them. On top of that, every model presented on GreenSloth has a manually curated package that consists of the model and the original figures, at least those we were able to recreate, of the publication. All this information is essential when working with any published model.
            </p>
            <p>
              A very difficult aspect of model finding is finding the model that fits your needs perfectly. To achieve this, you often need to compare several models, which can be a daunting task as there are many ways to compare. GreenSloth can facilitate this, as we have collected many of the common ways to compare models and made it as simple as comparing pants to each other on a fashion website.
            </p>
            <p>
              With these three main aspects of GreenSloth, we hope to elevate the hardship that comes with model work and make it more accessible to researchers who have troubles with this rather new field, as they are often the target audience of models.
