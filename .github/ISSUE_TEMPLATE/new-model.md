## <Model Name>

Use this issue to recommend new photosynthesis models to be added to GreenSloth. To ensure that the model fits in this project, the maintainers will take note of the following aspects:

- The main subject of the model is photosynthesis
- Model is constructed in mxlpy
- Model has an appropriate publication (a DOI is necessary)
- The model has scientific value
- Model directory has been created in the same format as others

Please only post this issue if you have finished presenting the model in the same format as the others. The best approach is to use [GreenSlothUtils](https://github.com/ElouenCorvest/GreenSlothUtils), where a step-by-step guide will instruct you on what to do and how. How you append your model files to this issue does not matter; it should just be clear where the model is located.

**Once you have read this, you can delete it, and submit your proposed model!**
