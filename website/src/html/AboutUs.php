          <p>The idea of GreenSloth has been a dream of the Computational Life Science Group, led by Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Matuszy≈Ñska, at the RWTH Aachen. We believe in making all our models ready for use and strive to make them as accessible as possible. To this end, we dedicate entire projects to bringing our field closer to our esteemed scientific colleagues, which is why GreenSloth holds significant importance for us.</p>
          <p>To initiate this project, we have assigned Elouen Corvest (<a href="mailto:elouen.corvest@rwth-aachen.de" target="_blank">elouen.corvest@rwth-aachen.de</a>) to develop the concept of GreenSloth, as he has gained extensive experience with photosynthesis models during his time in our Group. We are also proud of his work on ComPhot, our teaching tool on computational photosynthesis (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/plcell/koae101" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1093/plcell/koae101</a>), which he also represented us at the Second European Congress on Photosynthesis (EPS2) and even won a poster award. Therefore, we are confident in his experience and tenacity in creating GreenSloth to meet the expectations of the scientific community. Once his Master's Thesis duties have been completed in this project, we, the Group, will take the reins on the maintenance and improvement of GreenSloth while staying true to the core that Elouen has built.</p>
          <p>We are very enthusiastic about this project and what it represents. Therefore, we are pleased to receive any advice and support from the scientific community. If you have any ideas, or even models you wish to be represented here, please write us an email (<a href="mailto:elouen.corvest@rwth-aachen.de" target="_blank">elouen.corvest@rwth-aachen.de</a>)</p>
