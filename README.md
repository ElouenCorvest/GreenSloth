# GreenSloth - Written Texts

In 2022, Elouen, the creator of GreenSloth, wrote his Bachelor's thesis about comparing the popular and simple steady-state Farquhar, von Caemmerer, and Berry Model (FvCB model) and a kinetic photosynthesis model. While searching for the other model, he searched various public sources for scientific literature and tried to recreate several models. During this time, he arrived at one conclusion: modeling, especially photosynthesis, aims to help others understand more of the essential process of life on Earth. However, the scientific community has not achieved a common way to share its models. This is where the idea of GreenSloth first came into play.

During his further experience with photosynthetic models, he found that this issue was common for experts and amateurs in modelling, which inspired his mind even more to find a solution. He wanted to create a resource that collects popular photosynthesis models and enables an easier summary and accessibility, especially for amateurs in the modelling field.

With GreenSloth, Elouen hopes to facilitate researchers' access to the modelling world. He believes this is vital to understanding and coping with the complexity of photosynthesis. This website will enable even better scientific transparency.
