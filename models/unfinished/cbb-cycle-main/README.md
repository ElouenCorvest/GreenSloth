# Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle model

This repository contains two models of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle: the [Poolman 2000][1] implementation
of the [Pettersson 1988][2] model and a modified version containing a dynamic NADPH variable developed by Nima Saadat. 
Both models are written using the [modelbase][3] package.
