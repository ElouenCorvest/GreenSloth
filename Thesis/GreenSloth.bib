  abstract = {The field of applied linguistics is increasingly adopting open science practices. As open access publication gains traction, ethical issues emerge that need to be addressed by the field. This viewpoint paper addresses the concern that open science is not equally open for everyone. This paper describes how open access publication is increasingly being commercialized and explains how open access publication coincides with systemic inequality. We offer the following viewpoints for the field to consider:    We are morally obligated to make our research output accessible.  Hybrid, Gold, and Green open access publishing~lead to systemic inequality in open access publishing, benefiting commercial publishers and those working in research-intensive universities and rich countries.  Diamond open access publication removes the systemic inequalities; hence, Diamond open access should be prioritized over Hybrid, Gold, and Green open access publication models.  We should move away from publish-and-read agreements and Green open access publishing, because they prevent system change.  Through our choices in our work as researchers, editors, reviewers, authors and teachers, we can contribute to the transition towards truly equitable open access publishing practices.  Senior researchers are in the position and have the moral obligation to be drivers of these changes.},

  abstract = {In the fast-paced realm of digital transformation, businesses are increasingly pressured to innovate and boost efficiency to remain competitive and foster growth. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as game-changers across industries, revolutionizing various sectors by harnessing extensive text data to analyze and generate human-like text. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs often encounter challenges when dealing with domain-specific queries, potentially leading to inaccuracies in their outputs. In response, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a viable solution. By seamlessly integrating external data retrieval into text generation processes, RAG aims to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the generated content. However, existing literature reviews tend to focus primarily on the technological advancements of RAG, overlooking a comprehensive exploration of its applications. This paper seeks to address this gap by providing a thorough review of RAG applications, encompassing both task-specific and discipline-specific studies, while also outlining potential avenues for future research. By shedding light on current RAG research and outlining future directions, this review aims to catalyze further exploration and development in this dynamic field, thereby contributing to ongoing digital transformation efforts.},

Data provenance is recorded to ensure its findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. We demonstrate the practical application of our framework by linking two robots in Cambridge and Singapore for a collaborative closed-loop optimisation for a pharmaceutically-relevant aldol condensation reaction in real-time. The knowledge graph autonomously evolves toward the scientist's research goals, with the two robots effectively generating a Pareto front for cost-yield optimisation in three days.},

The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) and the Gene Expression Database (GXD) are core MGI databases that share data and system architecture. MGI serves as the central community resource of integrated information about mouse genome features, variation, expression, gene function, phenotype, and human disease models acquired from peer-reviewed publications, author submissions, and major bioinformatics resources. To facilitate integration and standardization of data, biocuration scientists annotate using terms from controlled metadata vocabularies and biological ontologies (e.g. Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, Mouse Developmental Anatomy, Disease Ontology, Gene Ontology, etc.), and by applying international community standards for gene, allele, and mouse strain nomenclature. MGI serves basic scientists, translational researchers, and data scientists by providing access to FAIR-compliant data in both human-readable and compute-ready formats. The MGI resource is accessible at https://informatics.jax.org. Here, we present an overview of the core data types represented in MGI and highlight recent enhancements to the resource with a focus on new data and functionality for MGD and GXD.},

Nevertheless, these measurements frequently need theoretical and computational support in order to unambiguously decipher and assign complex spectra. Linear-response theory provides an effective way to obtain the higher-order derivatives needed, but its applicability to modern exchange-correlation functionals and pseudopotential formalism remains limited. Here, we devise an automated, open-source, user-friendly approach based on density-functional theory and the electric-enthalpy functional to allow seamless calculation from first principles of infrared absorption and reflectivity, together with zone-center phonons, static dielectric tensor, and Raman spectra. By employing a finite-displacement and finite-field approach, we allow for the use of any functional, as well as an efficient treatment of large low-symmetry structures. Additionally, we propose a simple scheme for efficiently sampling the Brillouin zone at different electric fields. To demonstrate the capabilities of the present approach, we study ferroelectric LiNbO               3               crystal as a paradigmatic example, and predict infrared and Raman spectra using various (semi)local, Hubbard corrected, and hybrid functionals. Our results also show how PBE0 and extended Hubbard functionals (PBEsol+U+V) yield for this case the best match in term of peak positions and intensities, respectively.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Snapshots derived from the World Soil Information Service (WoSIS) are served freely to the international community. These static datasets provide quality-assessed and standardised soil profile data that can be used to support digital soil mapping and environmental applications at broad scale levels. Since the release of the preceding snapshot in 2019, refactored ETL (extract, transform and load) procedures for screening, ingesting and standardising disparate source data have been developed. In conjunction with this, the WoSIS data model was overhauled, making it compatible with the ISO~28258 and Observations and Measurements (O\&amp;M) domain models. Additional procedures for querying, serving and downloading the publicly available standardised data have been implemented using open software (e.g.~GraphQL API). Following up on a short discussion of these methodological developments we discuss the structure and content of the ``WoSIS 2023 snapshot''. A range of new soil datasets was shared with us, registered in the ISRIC World Data Centre for Soils (WDC-Soils) data repository and subsequently processed in accordance with the licences specified by the data providers. An important effort has been the processing of forest soil data collated in the framework of the EU-HoliSoils project. We paid special attention to the standardisation of soil property definitions, description of the soil analytical procedures and standardisation of the units of measurement. The 2023 snapshot considers soil chemical properties (total carbon, organic carbon, inorganic carbon (total carbonate equivalent), total nitrogen, phosphorus (extractable P, total P and P retention), soil pH, cation exchange capacity and electrical conductivity) and physical properties (soil texture (sand, silt and clay), bulk density, coarse fragments and water retention), grouped according to analytical procedures that are operationally comparable. Method options are defined for each analytical procedure (e.g.~pH measured in water, KCl or CaCl2 solution, molarity of the solution, and soil\,/\,solution ratio). For each profile we also provide the original soil classification (i.e.~FAO, WRB and USDA system with their version) and pedological horizon designations as far as these have been specified in the source databases. Three measures for ``fitness for intended use'' are provided to facilitate informed data use: (a)~positional uncertainty of the profile's site location, (b)~possible uncertainty associated with the operationally defined analytical procedures and (c)~date of sampling. The most recent (i.e.~dynamic) dataset, called wosis\_latest, is freely accessible via various web services. To permit consistent referencing and citation, we also provide a static snapshot (in this case, December~2023). This snapshot comprises quality-assessed and standardised data for 228\,000 geo-referenced profiles. The data come from 174 countries and represent more than 900\,000 soil layers (or horizons) and over 6 million records. The number of measurements for each soil property varies (greatly) between profiles and with depth, this generally depending on the objectives of the initial soil sampling programmes. In the coming years, we aim to gradually fill gaps in the geographic distribution of the profiles, as well as in the soil observations themselves, this subject to the sharing of a wider selection of ``public'' soil data by prospective data contributors; possible solutions for this are discussed. The WoSIS 2023 snapshot is archived and freely available at https://doi.org/10.17027/isric-wdcsoils-20231130 (Calisto et al., 2023).},

  abstract = {Abstract             Mitigating ongoing losses of insects and their key functions (e.g. pollination) requires tracking large-scale and long-term community changes. However, doing so has been hindered by the high diversity of insect species that requires prohibitively high investments of time, funding and taxonomic expertise when addressed with conventional tools. Here, we show that these concerns can be addressed through a comprehensive, scalable and cost-efficient DNA metabarcoding workflow. We use 1815 samples from 75 Malaise traps across Germany from 2019 and 2020 to demonstrate how metabarcoding can be incorporated into large-scale insect monitoring networks for less than 50~\texteuro{} per sample, including supplies, labour and maintenance. We validated the detected species using two publicly available databases (GBOL and GBIF) and the judgement of taxonomic experts. With an average of 1.4\,M sequence reads per sample we uncovered 10,803 validated insect species, of which 83.9\% were represented by a single Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU). We estimated another 21,043 plausible species, which we argue either lack a reference barcode or are undescribed. The total of 31,846 species is similar to the number of insect species known for Germany (\textasciitilde 35,500). Because Malaise traps capture only a subset of insects, our approach identified many species likely unknown from Germany or new to science.

Advancements in sequencing and multi-omics technologies have increased the availability of these data, but researchers face significant integration challenges. Knowledge graphs (KGs) are used to model complex phenomena, and methods exist to construct them automatically. However, tackling complex biomedical integration problems requires flexibility in the way knowledge is modeled. Moreover, existing KG construction methods provide robust tooling at the cost of fixed or limited choices among knowledge representation models. PheKnowLator (Phenotype Knowledge Translator) is a semantic ecosystem for automating the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) construction of ontologically grounded KGs with fully customizable knowledge representation. The ecosystem includes KG construction resources (e.g., data preparation APIs), analysis tools (e.g., SPARQL endpoint resources and abstraction algorithms), and benchmarks (e.g., prebuilt KGs). We evaluated the ecosystem by systematically comparing it to existing open-source KG construction methods and by analyzing its computational performance when used to construct 12 different large-scale KGs. With flexible knowledge representation, PheKnowLator enables fully customizable KGs without compromising performance or usability.},

Hence, effective design of websites helps firms/organizations to reach their aim. There are lots of design parameters that play an effective role on website design. These parameters are considered by researchers in some academic papers. However, none of the published articles takes into account both interactions among the design parameters and importance degrees of design parameters in terms of website types. Therefore, in the scope of this paper, in order to address these research gaps, an integrated multiple criteria decision making method including Delphi and DEMATEL (DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) techniques has been proposed for determining importance degrees of website design parameters. Furthermore, the website design parameters were determined based on detailed review of literature available. In addition, a new classification has been presented for websites. Finally, this paper indicates that the importance degrees of website design parameters are based on both website types and interaction among the design parameters. To illustrate the steps of the proposed algorithm, an application has been presented.},

  abstract = {GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are the two most widely used large language model (LLM) services. However, when and how these models are updated over time is opaque. Here, we evaluate the March 2023 and June 2023 versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on several diverse tasks: 1) math problems, 2) sensitive/dangerous questions, 3) opinion surveys, 4) multi-hop knowledge-intensive questions, 5) generating code, 6) U.S. Medical License tests, and 7) visual reasoning. We find that the performance and behavior of both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can vary greatly over time. For example, GPT-4 (March 2023) was reasonable at identifying prime vs. composite numbers (84\% accuracy) but GPT-4 (June 2023) was poor on these same questions (51\% accuracy). This is partly explained by a drop in GPT-4's amenity to follow chain-of-thought prompting. Interestingly, GPT-3.5 was much better in June than in March in this task. GPT-4 became less willing to answer sensitive questions and opinion survey questions in June than in March. GPT-4 performed better at multi-hop questions in June than in March, while GPT-3.5's performance dropped on this task. Both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 had more formatting mistakes in code generation in June than in March. We provide evidence that GPT-4's ability to follow user instructions has decreased over time, which is one common factor behind the many behavior drifts. Overall, our findings show that the behavior of the `same' LLM service can change substantially in a relatively short amount of time, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring of LLMs.},

Materials science, in particular, encompasses a variety of experimental and theoretical approaches that require careful benchmarking. Leaderboard efforts have been developed previously to mitigate these issues. However, a comprehensive comparison and benchmarking on an integrated platform with multiple data modalities with perfect and defect materials data is still lacking. This work introduces JARVIS-Leaderboard, an open-source and community-driven platform that facilitates benchmarking and enhances reproducibility. The platform allows users to set up benchmarks with custom tasks and enables contributions in the form of dataset, code, and meta-data submissions. We cover the following materials design categories: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Electronic Structure (ES), Force-fields (FF), Quantum Computation (QC), and Experiments (EXP). For AI, we cover several types of input data, including atomic structures, atomistic images, spectra, and text. For ES, we consider multiple ES approaches, software packages, pseudopotentials, materials, and properties, comparing results to experiment. For FF, we compare multiple approaches for material property predictions. For QC, we benchmark Hamiltonian simulations using various quantum algorithms and circuits. Finally, for experiments, we use the inter-laboratory approach to establish benchmarks. There are 1281 contributions to 274 benchmarks using 152 methods with more than 8 million data points, and the leaderboard is continuously expanding. The JARVIS-Leaderboard is available at the website:               https://pages.nist.gov/jarvis\_leaderboard/},

To build OpenDengue we systematically searched databases, ministry of health websites, peer reviewed literature and Pro-MED mail reports and extracted denominator-based case count data. We undertake standardisation and error checking protocols to ensure consistency and resolve discrepancies. We meticulously documented the extraction process to ensure records are attributable and reproducible. The OpenDengue database remains under development with plans for further disaggregation and user contributions are encouraged. This new dataset can be used to better understand the long-term drivers of dengue transmission, improve estimates of disease burden, targeting and evaluation of interventions and improving future projections.},

  abstract = {Introduction               Analysis of an individual's immunoglobulin (IG) gene repertoire requires the use of high-quality germline gene reference sets. When sets only contain alleles supported by strong evidence, AIRR sequencing (AIRR-seq) data analysis is more accurate and studies of the evolution of IG genes, their allelic variants and the expressed immune repertoire is therefore facilitated.                                         Methods               The Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire Community (AIRR-C) IG Reference Sets have been developed by including only human IG heavy and light chain alleles that have been confirmed by evidence from multiple high-quality sources. To further improve AIRR-seq analysis, some alleles have been extended to deal with short 3' or 5' truncations that can lead them to be overlooked by alignment utilities. To avoid other challenges for analysis programs, exact paralogs (e.g. IGHV1-69*01 and IGHV1-69D*01) are only represented once in each set, though alternative sequence names are noted in accompanying metadata.                                         Results and discussion                                The Reference Sets include less than half the previously recognised IG alleles (e.g. just 198 IGHV sequences), and also include a number of novel alleles: 8 IGHV alleles, 2 IGKV alleles and 5 IGLV alleles. Despite their smaller sizes, erroneous calls were eliminated, and excellent coverage was achieved when a set of repertoires comprising over 4 million V(D)J rearrangements from 99 individuals were analyzed using the Sets. The version-tracked AIRR-C IG Reference Sets are freely available at the OGRDB website (                 https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/germline\_sets/Human                 ) and will be regularly updated to include newly observed and previously reported sequences that can be confirmed by new high-quality data.},

Continued analytical improvements have made this technique capable of regularly achieving better than 0.1\% precision and accuracy of dates from commonly occurring high-U minerals across a wide range of geological ages and settings. To help maximize the long-term utility of published results, we present and discuss some recommendations for reporting ID-TIMS U-Pb geochronological data and associated metadata in accordance with accepted principles of data management. Further, given that the accuracy of reported ages typically depends on the interpretation applied to a set of individual dates, we discuss strategies for data interpretation. We anticipate that this paper will serve as an instructive guide for geologists who are publishing ID-TIMS U-Pb data, for laboratories generating the data, the wider geoscience community who use such data, and also editors of journals who wish to be informed about community standards. Combined, our recommendations should increase the utility, veracity, versatility, and ``half-life'' of ID-TIMS U-Pb geochronological data.},

  abstract = {Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a method to extend beyond the pre-trained knowledge of Large Language Models by augmenting the original prompt with relevant passages or documents retrieved by an Information Retrieval (IR) system. RAG has become increasingly important for Generative AI solutions, especially in enterprise settings or in any domain in which knowledge is constantly refreshed and cannot be memorized in the LLM. We argue here that the retrieval component of RAG systems, be it dense or sparse, deserves increased attention from the research community, and accordingly, we conduct the first comprehensive and systematic examination of the retrieval strategy of RAG systems. We focus, in particular, on the type of passages IR systems within a RAG solution should retrieve. Our analysis considers multiple factors, such as the relevance of the passages included in the prompt context, their position, and their number. One counter-intuitive finding of this work is that the retriever's highest-scoring documents that are not directly relevant to the query (e.g., do not contain the answer) negatively impact the effectiveness of the LLM. Even more surprising, we discovered that adding random documents in the prompt improves the LLM accuracy by up to 35\%. These results highlight the need to investigate the appropriate strategies when integrating retrieval with LLMs, thereby laying the groundwork for future research in this area.},

  abstract = {ArcaNN is a comprehensive framework that employs concurrent learning to generate training datasets for reactive MLIPs in the condensed phase.           ,              The emergence of artificial intelligence is profoundly impacting computational chemistry, particularly through machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Unlike traditional potential energy surface representations, MLIPs overcome the conventional computational scaling limitations by offering an effective combination of accuracy and efficiency for calculating atomic energies and forces to be used in molecular simulations. These MLIPs have significantly enhanced molecular simulations across various applications, including large-scale simulations of materials, interfaces, chemical reactions, and beyond. Despite these advances, the construction of training datasets---a critical component for the accuracy of MLIPs---has not received proportional attention, especially in the context of chemical reactivity, which depends on rare barrier-crossing events that are not easily included in the datasets. Here we address this gap by introducing ArcaNN, a comprehensive framework designed for generating training datasets for reactive MLIPs. ArcaNN employs a concurrent learning approach combined with advanced sampling techniques to ensure an accurate representation of high-energy geometries. The framework integrates automated processes for iterative training, exploration, new configuration selection, and energy and force labeling, all while ensuring reproducibility and documentation. We demonstrate ArcaNN's capabilities through two paradigm reactions: a nucleophilic substitution and a Diels--Alder reaction. These examples showcase its effectiveness, the uniformly low error of the resulting MLIP everywhere along the chemical reaction coordinate, and its potential for broad applications in reactive molecular dynamics. Finally, we provide guidelines for assessing the quality of MLIPs in reactive systems.},

  abstract = {Modelling of Nuclear Reactor Multiphysics: From Local Balance Equations to Macroscopic Models in Neutronics and Thermal-Hydraulics is an accessible guide to the advanced methods used to model nuclear reactor systems. The book addresses the frontier discipline of neutronic/thermal-hydraulic modelling of nuclear reactor cores, presenting the main techniques in a generic manner and for practical reactor calculations. The modelling of nuclear reactor systems is one of the most challenging tasks in complex system modelling, due to the many different scales and intertwined physical phenomena involved. The nuclear industry as well as the research institutes and universities heavily rely on the use of complex numerical codes. All the commercial codes are based on using different numerical tools for resolving the various physical fields, and to some extent the different scales, whereas the latest research platforms attempt to adopt a more integrated approach in resolving multiple scales and fields of physics. The book presents the main algorithms used in such codes for neutronic and thermal-hydraulic modelling, providing the details of the underlying methods, together with their assumptions and limitations. Because of the rapidly expanding use of coupled calculations for performing safety analyses, the analysists should be equally knowledgeable in all fields (i.e. neutron transport, fluid dynamics, heat transfer)},

  abstract = {Abstract             With increasing demands for precise water resource management, there is a growing need for advanced techniques in mapping water bodies. The currently deployed satellites provide complementary data that are either of high spatial or high temporal resolutions. As a result, there is a clear trade-off between space and time when considering a single data source. For the efficient monitoring of multiple environmental resources, various Earth science applications need data at high spatial and temporal resolutions. To address this need, many data fusion methods have been described in the literature, that rely on combining data snapshots from multiple sources. Traditional methods face limitations due to sensitivity to atmospheric disturbances and other environmental factors, resulting in noise, outliers, and missing data. This paper introduces Hydrological Generative Adversarial Network (Hydro-GAN), a novel machine learning-based method~that utilizes modified GANs to enhance boundary accuracy when mapping low-resolution MODIS data to high-resolution Landsat-8 images. We propose~a new non-saturating loss function for the Hydro-GAN generator, which maximizes the log of discriminator probabilities to promote stable updates and aid convergence. By focusing on reducing squared differences between real and synthetic images, our approach enhances training stability and overall performance. We specifically focus on mapping water bodies using MODIS and Landsat-8 imagery due to their relevance in water resource management tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Hydro-GAN in generating high-resolution water body maps, outperforming traditional methods in terms of boundary accuracy and overall quality.           ,              Plain Language Summary             This study addresses the imperative challenges of water resource management, including coastal zone oversight, detecting sea border shifts due to rising waters, and erosion tracking. Satellite data currently offers a choice between high spatial detail with infrequent updates or lower spatial detail with more frequent updates, presenting a trade-off between data precision and frequency. To efficiently monitor environmental resources like water bodies, we require data with both high spatial detail and frequent updates. To meet this need, we introduce the Hydrological Generative Adversarial Network, a novel machine learning tool that enhances data clarity, particularly in outlining water bodies. In testing, we employed images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite, providing less detailed images, and the Land Remote-Sensing Satellite, offering highly detailed imagery. In essence, this study enhances water resource management by effectively combining data from multiple sources, even in adverse conditions, potentially advancing environmental protection and management efforts.           ,              Key Points                                                                Remote sensing data augmentation for improving the accuracy of environmental assessments can be achieved using adversarial networks                                                     High spatiotemporal resolution of water bodies data enhances the precision of their areal forecasting                                                     Shape and areal accuracies play an important role for efficient spatiotemporal data interpolation},

  abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a world-wide public health threat that is projected to lead to 10 million annual deaths globally by 2050. The AMR public health issue has led to the development of action plans to combat AMR, including improved antimicrobial stewardship, development of new antimicrobials, and advanced monitoring. The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) led by the United States (U.S) Food and Drug Administration along with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and U.S. Department of Agriculture has monitored antimicrobial resistant bacteria in retail meats, humans, and food animals since the mid 1990's. NARMS is currently exploring an integrated One Health monitoring model recognizing that human, animal, plant, and environmental systems are linked to public health. Since 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has led an interagency NARMS environmental working group (EWG) to implement a surface water AMR monitoring program (SWAM) at watershed and national scales. The NARMS EWG divided the development of the environmental monitoring effort into five areas: (i) defining objectives and questions, (ii) designing study/sampling design, (iii) selecting AMR indicators, (iv) establishing analytical methods, and (v) developing data management/analytics/metadata plans. For each of these areas, the consensus among the scientific community and literature was reviewed and carefully considered prior to the development of this environmental monitoring program. The data produced from the SWAM effort will help develop robust surface water monitoring programs with the goal of assessing public health risks associated with AMR pathogens in surface water (e.g., recreational water exposures), provide a comprehensive picture of how resistant strains are related spatially and temporally within a watershed, and help assess how anthropogenic drivers and intervention strategies impact the transmission of AMR within human, animal, and environmental systems.},

Models are important tools for informing action, and their development and use present opportunities to center equity in process and outcomes. This Perspective highlights progress in integrating equity into systems modeling in sustainability science, as well as key challenges, tensions, and future directions. We present a conceptual framework for equity in systems modeling, focused on its distributional, procedural, and recognitional dimensions. We discuss examples of how modelers engage with these different dimensions throughout the modeling process and from across a range of modeling approaches and topics, including water resources, energy systems, air quality, and conservation. Synthesizing across these examples, we identify significant advances in enhancing procedural and recognitional equity by reframing models as tools to explore pluralism in worldviews and knowledge systems; enabling models to better represent distributional inequity through new computational techniques and data sources; investigating the dynamics that can drive inequities by linking different modeling approaches; and developing more nuanced metrics for assessing equity outcomes. We also identify important future directions, such as an increased focus on using models to identify pathways to transform underlying conditions that lead to inequities and move toward desired futures. By looking at examples across the diverse fields within sustainability science, we argue that there are valuable opportunities for mutual learning on how to use models more effectively as tools to support sustainable and equitable futures.},

Generating experimental toxicity data is, however, resource-intensive and time-consuming. Computational methods are fast and cost-efficient alternatives, but the low accuracy and narrow applicability domains have made their adaptation slow. Here, we present a AI-based model for predicting chemical toxicity. The model uses transformers to capture toxicity-specific features directly from the chemical structures and deep neural networks to predict effect concentrations. The model showed high predictive performance for all tested organism groups---algae, aquatic invertebrates and fish---and has, in comparison to commonly used QSAR methods, a larger applicability domain and a considerably lower error. When the model was trained on data with multiple effect concentrations (EC               50               /EC               10               ), the performance was further improved.

  abstract = {Abstract             This article proposes a framework of linked software agents that continuously interact with an underlying knowledge graph to automatically assess the impacts of potential flooding events. It builds on the idea of connected digital twins based on the World Avatar dynamic knowledge graph to create a semantically rich asset of data, knowledge, and computational capabilities accessible to humans, applications, and artificial intelligence. We develop three new ontologies to describe and link environmental measurements and their respective reporting stations, flood events, and their potential impact on population and built infrastructure as well as the built environment of a city itself. These coupled ontologies are deployed to dynamically instantiate near real-time data from multiple fragmented sources into the World Avatar. Sequences of autonomous agents connected via the derived information framework automatically assess consequences of newly instantiated data, such as newly raised flood warnings, and cascade respective updates through the graph to ensure up-to-date insights into the number of people and building stock value at risk. Although we showcase the strength of this technology in the context of flooding, our findings suggest that this system-of-systems approach is a promising solution to build holistic digital twins for various other contexts and use cases to support truly interoperable and smart cities.},

Therefore, there is a big need for software tools that allow access to diverse simulation and modeling methods as well as support for the usage of these methods.             Results: Here, we present COPASI, a platform-independent and user-friendly biochemical simulator that offers several unique features. We discuss numerical issues with these features; in particular, the criteria to switch between stochastic and deterministic simulation methods, hybrid deterministic--stochastic methods, and the importance of random number generator numerical resolution in stochastic simulation.

The structure of computational models is articulated using the concepts of construction assumptions and correction sets. The existence of these features indicates that certain conventionalist views are incorrect, in particular it suggests that computational models come with an interpretation that cannot be removed as well as a prior justification. A form of selective realism is described which denies that one can simply read the ontological commitments from the theory itself.},

Our analysis of current agent benchmarks and evaluation practices reveals several shortcomings that hinder their usefulness in real-world applications. First, there is a narrow focus on accuracy without attention to other metrics. As a result, SOTA agents are needlessly complex and costly, and the community has reached mistaken conclusions about the sources of accuracy gains. Our focus on cost in addition to accuracy motivates the new goal of jointly optimizing the two metrics. We design and implement one such optimization, showing its potential to greatly reduce cost while maintaining accuracy. Second, the benchmarking needs of model and downstream developers have been conflated, making it hard to identify which agent would be best suited for a particular application. Third, many agent benchmarks have inadequate holdout sets, and sometimes none at all. This has led to agents that are fragile because they take shortcuts and overfit to the benchmark in various ways. We prescribe a principled framework for avoiding overfitting. Finally, there is a lack of standardization in evaluation practices, leading to a pervasive lack of reproducibility. We hope that the steps we introduce for addressing these shortcomings will spur the development of agents that are useful in the real world and not just accurate on benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Tools based on artificial intelligence (AI) are currently revolutionising many fields, yet their applications are often limited by the lack of suitable training data in programmatically accessible format. Here we propose an effective solution to make data scattered in various locations and formats accessible for data-driven and machine learning applications using the overlay databank format. To demonstrate the practical relevance of such approach, we present the NMRlipids Databank---a community-driven, open-for-all database featuring programmatic access to quality-evaluated atom-resolution molecular dynamics simulations of cellular membranes. Cellular membrane lipid composition is implicated in diseases and controls major biological functions, but membranes are difficult to study experimentally due to their intrinsic disorder and complex phase behaviour. While MD simulations have been useful in understanding membrane systems, they require significant computational resources and often suffer from inaccuracies in model parameters. Here, we demonstrate how programmable interface for flexible implementation of data-driven and machine learning applications, and rapid access to simulation data through a graphical user interface, unlock possibilities beyond current MD simulation and experimental studies to understand cellular membranes. The proposed overlay databank concept can be further applied to other biomolecules, as well as in other fields where similar barriers hinder the AI revolution.},

Tumor genotypes induce states in cellular subsystems that are integrated with drug structure to predict response to therapy and, simultaneously, learn biological mechanisms underlying the drug response. DrugCell predictions are accurate in cell lines and also stratify clinical outcomes. Analysis of DrugCell mechanisms leads directly to the design of synergistic drug combinations, which we validate systematically by combinatorial CRISPR, drug-drug screening in~vitro, and patient-derived xenografts.

In September 2020, 90 areas with favorable geological conditions were identified as part of step 1 in phase 1 of the Site Selection Act. Representative preliminary safety analyses are to be carried out next~ to support decisions on the question, which siting regions should undergo surface-based exploration. These safety analyses are supported by numerical simulations building on geoscientific and technical data. The models that are taken into account are associated with various sources of uncertainties. Addressing these uncertainties and the robustness of the decisions pertaining to sites and design choices is a central component of the site selection process. In that context, important research objectives are associated with the question of how uncertainty should be treated through the various data collection, modeling and decision-making processes of the site selection procedure, and how the robustness of the repository system should be improved. BGE, therefore, established an interdisciplinary research cluster to identify open questions and to address the gaps in knowledge in six complementary research projects. In this paper, we introduce the overall purpose and the five thematic groups that constitute this research cluster. We discuss the specific questions addressed as well as the proposed methodologies in the context of the challenges of the site selection process in Germany. Finally, some conclusions are drawn on the potential benefits of a large method-centered research cluster in terms of simulation data management.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The Global Ocean Data Analysis Project (GLODAP) is a synthesis effort providing regular compilations of surface to bottom ocean biogeochemical bottle data, with an emphasis on seawater inorganic carbon chemistry and related variables determined through chemical analysis of seawater samples. GLODAPv2.2023 is an update of the previous version, GLODAPv2.2022 (Lauvset et al., 2022). The major changes are as follows: data from 23 new cruises were added. In addition, a number of changes were made to the data included in GLODAPv2.2022. GLODAPv2.2023 includes measurements from more than 1.4~million water samples from the global oceans collected on 1108 cruises. The data for the now 13 GLODAP core variables (salinity, oxygen, nitrate, silicate, phosphate, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, pH, chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11), CFC-12, CFC-113, CCl4, and SF6) have undergone extensive quality control with a focus on the systematic evaluation of bias. The data are available in two formats: (i) as submitted by the data originator but converted to World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) exchange format and (ii) as a merged data product with adjustments applied to minimize bias. For the present annual update, adjustments for the 23 new cruises were derived by comparing those data with the data from the 1085 quality-controlled cruises in the GLODAPv2.2022 data product using crossover analysis. SF6 data from all cruises were evaluated by comparison with CFC-12 data measured on the same cruises. For nutrients and ocean carbon dioxide (CO2), chemistry comparisons to estimates based on empirical algorithms provided additional context for adjustment decisions. The adjustments that we applied are intended to remove potential biases from errors related to measurement, calibration, and data-handling practices without removing known or likely time trends or variations in the variables evaluated. The compiled and adjusted data product is believed to be consistent to better than 0.005 in salinity, 1\,\% in oxygen, 2\,\% in nitrate, 2\,\% in silicate, 2\,\% in phosphate, 4\,\textmu mol\,kg-1 in dissolved inorganic carbon, 4\,\textmu mol\,kg-1 in total alkalinity, 0.01--0.02 in pH (depending on region), and 5\,\% in the halogenated transient tracers. The other variables included in the compilation, such as isotopic tracers and discrete CO2 fugacity (fCO2), were not subjected to bias comparison or adjustments. The original data, their documentation, and DOI codes are available at the Ocean Carbon and Acidification Data System of NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), which also provides access to the merged data product. This is provided as a single global file and as four regional ones -- the Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans -- under https://doi.org/10.25921/zyrq-ht66 (Lauvset et al., 2023). These bias-adjusted product files also include significant ancillary and approximated data, which were obtained by interpolation of, or calculation from, measured data. This living data update documents the GLODAPv2.2023 methods and provides a broad overview of the secondary quality control procedures and results.},

Identifying genes that influence antibiotic susceptibility could open the door to novel antimicrobial strategies, including targets for new synergistic drug combinations. Here, we developed a genome-wide CRISPR interference library for                 Staphylococcus aureus                 , demonstrated its use by quantifying gene fitness in different strains through CRISPRi-seq, and used it to identify genes that modulate susceptibility to the lipoglycopeptide dalbavancin. By exposing the library to sublethal concentrations of dalbavancin using both CRISPRi-seq and direct selection methods, we not only found genes previously reported to be involved in antibiotic susceptibility but also identified genes thus far unknown to affect antibiotic tolerance. Importantly, some of these genes could not have been detected by more conventional transposon-based knockout approaches because they are essential for growth, stressing the complementary value of CRISPRi-based methods. Notably, knockdown of a gene encoding the uncharacterized protein KapB specifically sensitizes the cells to dalbavancin, but not to other antibiotics of the same class, whereas knockdown of the Shikimate pathway showed the opposite effect. The results presented here demonstrate the promise of CRISPRi-seq screens to identify genes and pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility and pave the way to explore alternative antimicrobial treatments through these insights.                                               IMPORTANCE                                    Antibiotic resistance is a challenge for treating staphylococcal infections. Identifying genes that affect how antibiotics work could help create new treatments. In our study, we made a CRISPR interference library for                   Staphylococcus aureus                   and used this to find which genes are critical for growth and also mapped genes that are important for antibiotic sensitivity, focusing on the lipoglycopeptide antibiotic dalbavancin.

Identifying genes that affect how antibiotics work could help create new treatments. In our study, we made a CRISPR interference library for               Staphylococcus aureus               and used this to find which genes are critical for growth and also mapped genes that are important for antibiotic sensitivity, focusing on the lipoglycopeptide antibiotic dalbavancin. With this method, we identified genes that altered the sensitivity to dalbavancin upon knockdown, including genes involved in different cellular functions.

It is determined by the product of the available light energy and by the genetically determined properties: efficiency of light capture (               {$\varepsilon$}               i               ), the efficiency of conversion of the intercepted light into biomass (               {$\varepsilon$}               c               ) and the proportion of biomass partitioned into grain (               {$\eta$}               ). Plant breeding brings               {$\eta$}               and               {$\varepsilon$}               i               close to their theoretical maxima, leaving               {$\varepsilon$}               c               , primarily determined by photosynthesis, as the only remaining major prospect for improving               Y               p               . Leaf photosynthetic rate, however, is poorly correlated with yield when different genotypes of a crop species are compared. This led to the viewpoint that improvement of leaf photosynthesis has little value for improving               Y               p               . By contrast, the many recent experiments that compare the growth of a genotype in current and future projected elevated [CO               2               ] environments show that increase in leaf photosynthesis is closely associated with similar increases in yield. Are there opportunities to achieve similar increases by genetic manipulation? Six potential routes of increasing               {$\varepsilon$}               c               by improving photosynthetic efficiency were explored, ranging from altered canopy architecture to improved regeneration of the acceptor molecule for CO               2               . Collectively, these changes could improve               {$\varepsilon$}               c               and, therefore,               Y               p               by               c               . 50\%. Because some changes could be achieved by transgenic technology, the time of the development of commercial cultivars could be considerably less than by conventional breeding and potentially, within 10--15{$\quad$}years.},

In response, computational systems and network medicine tools have emerged to identify potential drug repurposing candidates. However, these tools often require complex installation and lack intuitive visual network mining capabilities. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Drugst.One, a platform that assists specialized computational medicine tools in becoming user-friendly, web-based utilities for drug repurposing. With just three lines of code, Drugst.One turns any systems biology software into an interactive web tool for modeling and analyzing complex protein-drug-disease networks. Demonstrating its broad adaptability, Drugst.One has been successfully integrated with 21 computational systems medicine tools. Available at https://drugst.one, Drugst.One has significant potential for streamlining the drug discovery process, allowing researchers to focus on essential aspects of pharmaceutical treatment research.},

To provide a platform to support universal sharing, easy accessibility and model reproducibility, BioModels (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), a repository for mathematical models, was established in 2005. The current BioModels platform allows submission of models encoded in diverse modelling formats, including SBML, CellML, PharmML, COMBINE archive, MATLAB, Mathematica, R, Python or C++. The models submitted to BioModels are curated to verify the computational representation of the biological process and the reproducibility of the simulation results in the reference publication. The curation also involves encoding models in standard formats and annotation with controlled vocabularies following MIRIAM (minimal information required in the annotation of biochemical models)~guidelines. BioModels now accepts large-scale submission of auto-generated computational models. With gradual growth in content over 15 years, BioModels currently hosts about 2000 models from the published literature. With about 800 curated models, BioModels has become the world's largest repository of curated models and emerged as the third most used data resource after PubMed and Google Scholar among the scientists who use modelling in their research. Thus, BioModels benefits modellers by providing access to reliable and semantically enriched curated models in standard formats that are easy to share, reproduce and reuse.},

Many works from the literature give general guidelines to favor reproducibility. However, none of them provide both a practical set of steps or software tools to help in this process. In this article, we propose a practical methodology to favor reproducibility in optimization problems tackled with stochastic methods. This methodology is divided into three main steps, where the researcher is assisted by software tools which implement state-of-the-art techniques related to this process. The methodology has been applied to study the double-row facility layout problem (DRFLP) where we propose a new algorithm able to obtain better results than the state-of-the-art methods. To this aim, we have also replicated the previous methods in order to complete the study with a new set of larger instances. All the produced artifacts related to the methodology and the study of the target problem are available in Zenodo.},

Bottom-trawl surveys are conducted all over the world and represent a unique opportunity to understand ocean biogeography, macroecology, and global change. However, combining these data together for cross-ecosystem analyses remains challenging. Here, we present an integrated dataset of 29 publicly available bottom-trawl surveys conducted in national waters of 18 countries that are standardized and pre-processed, covering a total of 2,170 sampled fish taxa and 216,548 hauls collected from 1963 to 2021. We describe the processing steps to create the dataset, flags, and standardization methods that we developed to assist users in conducting spatio-temporal analyses with stable regional survey footprints. The aim of this dataset is to support research, marine conservation, and management in the context of global change.},

Climate-sensitive growth and yield models (CSGYMs) are therefore urgently needed to support forest management decisions. The Canadian Forest Service (CFS) has developed a strategic plan to advance climate-sensitive growth and yield modeling in Canada through collaboration with provincial and territorial agencies, as well as other partners. The primary objective of this plan is to provide a national-level modelling approach to predicting and managing forest growth, mortality, and other ecosystem services. The climate sensitive growth and yield modelling initiative emphasizes collaboration, open data, and open-source code principles to ensure widespread accessibility and uptake of models, thus contributing to the sustainable management of forest resources. This technical review reports on the status of growth and yield models currently applied in each province and territory, assesses the level of climate sensitivity associated with each of these models, synthesizes the relevant modeling approaches and input data required to implement climate sensitivity into these models, and suggests possible pathways for achieving CSGYM at a national scale. Widespread collaboration will be the key to advancing the development of CSGYMs.},

Materials and methods               We analyzed 3049 posts and comments extracted from a self-identified clinician subreddit using unsupervised machine learning via Latent Dirichlet Allocation and a structured qualitative analysis methodology.                                         Results               Analysis uncovered 14 salient themes of ethical implications, which we further consolidated into 4 overarching domains reflecting ethical issues around various clinical applications of LLM in healthcare, LLM coding, algorithm, and data governance, LLM's role in health equity and the distribution of public health services, and the relationship between users (human) and LLM systems (machine).

These interactions are responsible for a large portion of the uncertainty in wind plant modeling tools that are used to represent wind plant performance both prior to construction and during operation and can negatively impact wind energy profitability. The AWAKEN field campaign will provide data for validation, ultimately improving modeling and lowering these uncertainties. The field campaign is designed to address seven testable hypotheses through the analysis of the observations collected by numerous instruments at 13 ground-based locations and on five wind turbines. The location of the field campaign in Northern Oklahoma was chosen to leverage existing observational facilities operated by the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program in close proximity to five operating wind plants. The vast majority of the observations from the experiment are publicly available to researchers and industry members worldwide, which the authors hope will advance the state of the science for wind plants and lead to lower cost and increased reliability of wind energy systems.},

The lack of a standard description format, lack of stringent reviewing and authors' carelessness are the main causes for incomplete model descriptions. With today's increased interest in detailed biochemical models, it is necessary to define a minimum quality standard for the encoding of those models. We propose a set of rules for curating quantitative models of biological systems. These rules define procedures for encoding and annotating models represented in machine-readable form. We believe their application will enable users to (i) have confidence that curated models are an accurate reflection of their associated reference descriptions, (ii) search collections of curated models with precision, (iii) quickly identify the biological phenomena that a given curated model or model constituent represents and (iv) facilitate model reuse and composition into large subcellular models.},

The four stages differ among many dimensions, including cost, access, and persistence of change. Pretraining is always very expensive and in-context learning is nearly costless. Pretraining and fine-tuning change the model in a more persistent manner, while in-context learning and filters make less durable alterations. These are but two of many such distinctions reviewed in this Essay. Legal scholars, policymakers, and judges need to understand the differences between the four stages as they try to shape and direct what these models do. Although legal and policy interventions can (and probably will) occur during all four stages, many will best be directed at the fine-tuning stage. Fine-tuning will often represent the best balance between power, precision, and disruption of the approaches.},

To address these challenges, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has created NCBI Datasets. This resource provides straightforward, comprehensive, and scalable access to biological sequences, annotations, and metadata for a wide range of taxa. Following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data management principles, NCBI Datasets offers user-friendly web interfaces, command-line tools, and documented APIs, empowering researchers to access NCBI data seamlessly. The data is delivered as packages of sequences and metadata, thus facilitating improved data retrieval, sharing, and usability in research. Moreover, this data delivery method fosters effective data attribution and promotes its further reuse. This paper outlines the current scope of data accessible through NCBI Datasets and explains various options for exploring and downloading the data.},

Laboratory Information Systems (LIS), introduced in the 1970s, have transformed into sophisticated information technology (IT) components that integrate with various digital tools, enhancing data retrieval and exchange. However, the current capabilities of LIS are not sufficient to rapidly save the extensive data, generated during the total testing process (TTP), beyond just test results. This opinion paper discusses qualitative types of TTP data, proposing how to divide laboratory-generated information into two categories, namely metadata and peridata. Being both metadata and peridata information derived from the testing process, it is proposed that the first is useful to describe the characteristics of data, while the second is for interpretation of test results. Together with standardizing preanalytical coding, the subdivision of laboratory-generated information into metadata or peridata might enhance ML studies, also by facilitating the adherence of laboratory-derived data to the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. Finally, integrating metadata and peridata into LIS can improve data usability, support clinical utility, and advance AI model development in healthcare, emphasizing the need for standardized data management practices.},

We calculate the energy use and carbon footprint of several recent large models---T5, Meena, GShard, Switch Transformer, and GPT-3---and refine earlier estimates for the neural architecture search that found Evolved Transformer. We highlight the following opportunities to improve energy efficiency and CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e): \ding{108} Large but sparsely activated DNNs can consume {$<$}1/10th the energy of large, dense DNNs without sacrificing accuracy despite using as many or even more parameters. \ding{108} Geographic location matters for ML workload scheduling since the fraction of carbon-free energy and resulting CO2e vary \textasciitilde 5X-10X, even within the same country and the same organization. We are now optimizing where and when large models are trained. \ding{108} Specific datacenter infrastructure matters, as Cloud datacenters can be \textasciitilde 1.4-2X more energy efficient than typical datacenters, and the ML-oriented accelerators inside them can be \textasciitilde 2-5X more effective than off-the-shelf systems. Remarkably, the choice of DNN, datacenter, and processor can reduce the carbon footprint up to \textasciitilde 100-1000X. These large factors also make retroactive estimates of energy cost difficult. To avoid miscalculations, we believe ML papers requiring large computational resources should make energy consumption and CO2e explicit when practical. We are working to be more transparent about energy use and CO2e in our future research. To help reduce the carbon footprint of ML, we believe energy usage and CO2e should be a key metric in evaluating models, and we are collaborating with MLPerf developers to include energy usage during training and inference in this industry standard benchmark.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This article reports on the state-of-the-art and future perspectives of machine learning (ML) in petrology. To achieve this goal, it first introduces the basics of ML, including definitions, core concepts, and applications. Then, it starts reviewing the state-of-the-art of ML in petrology. Established applications mainly concern the so-called data-driven discovery and involve specific tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction, classification, and regression. Among them, clustering and dimensionality reduction have been demonstrated to be valuable for decoding the chemical record stored in igneous and metamorphic phases and to enhance data visualization, respectively. Classification and regression tasks find applications, for example, in petrotectonic discrimination and geo-thermobarometry, respectively. The main core of the manuscript consists of depicting emerging trends and the future directions of ML in petrological investigations. I propose a future scenario where ML methods will progressively integrate and support established petrological methods in automating time-consuming and repetitive tasks, improving current models, and boosting discovery. In this framework, promising applications include (1) the acquisition of new multimodal petrologic data; (2) the development of data fusion techniques, physics-informed ML models, and ML-supported numerical simulations; and (3) the continuous exploration of the ML potential in petrology. To boost the contribution of ML in petrology, our main challenges are: (1) to improve the ability of ML models to capture the complexity of petrologic processes, (2) progressively link ML algorithms with the physical and thermodynamic nature of the investigated problems, and (3) to start a collaborative effort among researchers coming from different disciplines, both in research and teaching.},

Database design establishes the range of questions that can be addressed, and validation techniques can enhance data quality. Here, six validated global isotopic databases provide extensive records of analyses from U-Pb in detrital zircon, Lu-Hf in zircon, Sm-Nd from whole rocks, and {$\delta$}               18               O in zircon. The U-Pb detrital zircon records are segregated into three independently sampled databases. Independent samples are critical for testing the replicability of results, a key requisite for gaining confidence in the validity of a hypothesis. An advantage of our updated databases is that a hypothesis developed from one of the global detrital zircon databases can be immediately tested with the other two independent detrital zircon databases to assess the replicability of results. The independent {$\varepsilon$}Hf(               t               ) and {$\varepsilon$}Nd(               t               ) values provide similar means of testing for replicable results.

The established data-related requisites within science literacy now fall short of addressing the evolving needs of researchers and STEM students. Consequently, the emergence of science data literacy becomes imperative. However, notwithstanding the escalating importance of science data literacy, a comprehensive definition and conceptual framework are still elusive, posing challenges to effective assessment.                                         Results               This study analyzes the science literacy frameworks of six international organizations and countries, including the OECD, and reviews 16 data literacy-related literature sources identified using the PRISMA process. We also consider the characteristics of science data. Based on these sources, we clarify the connotation of science data literacy and construct a tailored conceptual framework for college students majoring in STEM. The framework undergoes two rounds of Delphi method refinement to enhance its applicability. Subsequently, we created and piloted a set of questions using physics, astronomy, geography, and other STEM subjects as examples to assess science data literacy. The revised assessment tool was then used in a formal test with 198 university students, employing Rasch modeling to evaluate its effectiveness. The tool's validity in assessing science data literacy was confirmed.                                         Conclusions               This study offers a systematic and comprehensive conceptual framework for science data literacy tailored to STEM undergraduates. Endorsed by experts, the framework outlines essential literacies for STEM students in handling science data. The developed assessment tool enables educators to measure students' science data literacy levels and serves as a scientific guide to enhance their competencies in this area.},

In an online study, we collected ratings of colorfulness, visual complexity, and visual appeal of a set of 450 websites from 548 volunteers. Based on these data, we developed computational models that accurately measure the perceived visual complexity and colorfulness of website screenshots. In combination with demographic variables such as a user's education level and age, these models explain approximately half of the variance in the ratings of aesthetic appeal given after viewing a website for 500ms only.},

Its primary focus is integrating experimental gene function information from the peer-reviewed literature and codifying it as controlled vocabulary annotations. Our goal is to produce a ``gold standard'' functional annotation set that reflects the current state of knowledge about the Arabidopsis genome. At the same time, the resource serves as a nexus for community-based collaborations aimed at improving data quality, access, and reuse. For the past decade, our work has been made possible by subscriptions from our global user base. This update covers our ongoing biocuration work, some of our modernization efforts that contribute to the first major infrastructure overhaul since 2011, the introduction of JBrowse2, and the resource's role in community activities such as organizing the structural reannotation of the genome. For gene function assessment, we used gene ontology annotations as a metric to evaluate: (1) what is currently known about Arabidopsis gene function and (2) the set of ``unknown'' genes. Currently, 74\% of the proteome has been annotated to at least one gene ontology term. Of those loci, half have experimental support for at least one of the following aspects: molecular function, biological process, or cellular component. Our work sheds light on the genes for which we have not yet identified any published experimental data and have no functional annotation. Drawing attention to these unknown genes highlights knowledge gaps and potential sources of novel discoveries.},

Here, we analyze how users and curators of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) are flagging and curating sequences derived from nomenclatural type material, which is the only way to improve the quality of DNA-based identification in the long run. For prokaryotes, 18,281 genome assemblies from type strains have been curated by NCBI staff and improve the quality of prokaryote naming. For Fungi, type-derived sequences representing over 21,000 species are now essential for fungus naming and identification. For the remaining eukaryotes, however, the numbers of sequences identifiable as type-derived are minuscule, representing only 739 species of arthropods, 1542 vertebrates, and 125 embryophytes. An increase in the production and curation of such sequences will come from (i) sequencing of types or topotypic specimens in museum collections, (ii) the March 2023 rule changes at the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration requiring more metadata for specimens, and (iii) efforts by data submitters to facilitate curation, including informing NCBI curators about a specimen's type status. We illustrate different type-data submission journeys and provide best-practice examples from a range of organisms. Expanding the number of type-derived sequences in DNA databases, especially of eukaryotes, is crucial for capturing, documenting, and protecting biodiversity.},

As one of the most scalable and fastest developing sensor technologies, we describe a framework for automated, image-based monitoring of nocturnal insects---from sensor development and field deployment to workflows for data processing and publishing. Sensors comprise a light to attract insects, a camera for collecting images and a computer for scheduling, data storage and processing. Metadata is important to describe sampling schedules that balance the capture of relevant ecological information against power and data storage limitations. Large data volumes of images from automated systems necessitate scalable and effective data processing. We describe computer vision approaches for the detection, tracking and classification of insects, including models built from existing aggregations of labelled insect images. Data from automated camera systems necessitate approaches that account for inherent biases. We advocate models that explicitly correct for bias in species occurrence or abundance estimates resulting from the imperfect detection of species or individuals present during sampling occasions. We propose ten priorities towards a step-change in automated monitoring of nocturnal insects, a vital task in the face of rapid biodiversity loss from global threats.

  abstract = {During photosynthesis, organisms respond to their energy demand and ensure the supply of energy and redox equivalents that sustain metabolism. Hence, the photosynthetic apparatus can, and in fact should, be treated as an integrated supply-demand system. Any imbalance in the energy produced and consumed can lead to adverse reactions, such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reaction centres of both photosystems are known sites of ROS production. Here, we investigate in particular the central role of Photosystem I (PSI) in this tightly regulated system. Using a computational approach we have expanded a previously published mechanistic model of C3 photosynthesis by including ROS producing and scavenging reactions around PSI. These include two water to water reactions mediated by Plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) and Mehler and the ascorbate-glutathione (ASC-GSH) cycle, as a main non-enzymatic antioxidant. We have used this model to predict flux distributions through alternative electron pathways under various environmental stress conditions by systematically varying light intensity and enzymatic activity of key reactions. In particular, we studied the link between ROS formation and activation of pathways around PSI as potential scavenging mechanisms. This work shines light on the role of alternative electron pathways in photosynthetic acclimation and investigates the effect of environmental perturbations on PSI activity in the context of metabolic productivity.},

  abstract = {Guidelines for managing scientific data have been established under the FAIR principles requiring that data be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. In many scientific disciplines, especially computational biology, both data and models are key to progress. For this reason, and recognizing that such models are a very special type of "data", we argue that computational models, especially mechanistic models prevalent in medicine, physiology and systems biology, deserve a complementary set of guidelines. We propose the CURE principles, emphasizing that models should be Credible, Understandable, Reproducible, and Extensible. We delve into each principle, discussing verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification for model credibility; the clarity of model descriptions and annotations for understandability; adherence to standards and open science practices for reproducibility; and the use of open standards and modular code for extensibility and reuse. We outline recommended and baseline requirements for each aspect of CURE, aiming to enhance the impact and trustworthiness of computational models, particularly in biomedical applications where credibility is paramount. Our perspective underscores the need for a more disciplined approach to modeling, aligning with emerging trends such as Digital Twins and emphasizing the importance of data and modeling standards for interoperability and reuse. Finally, we emphasize that given the non-trivial effort required to implement the guidelines, the community moves to automate as many of the guidelines as possible.},

As the generation and application of stable isotope data continues to grow exponentially, so does the need for a unifying data repository to improve accessibility and promote collaborative engagement. This paper provides an overview of the design, development, and implementation of IsoBank (               www.isobank.org               ), a community-driven initiative to create an open-access repository for stable isotope data implemented online in 2021. A central goal of IsoBank is to provide a web-accessible database supporting interdisciplinary stable isotope research and educational opportunities. To achieve this goal, we convened a multi-disciplinary group of over 40 analytical experts, stable isotope researchers, database managers, and web developers to collaboratively design the database. This paper outlines the main features of IsoBank and provides a focused description of the core metadata structure. We present plans for future database and tool development and engagement across the scientific community. These efforts will help facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration among the many users of stable isotopic data while also offering useful data resources and standardization of metadata reporting across eco-geoinformatics landscapes.},

It also looks at how dataset size, adjusting hyperparameters, and training time affect performance, giving insights into the balance between efficiency and accuracy. The results show that even with limited data and hardware, the fine-tuned model can still learn specific knowledge, adapt to new tasks, and provide accurate responses.

  abstract = {The optimization, intensification, and scale-up of photochemical processes constitute a particular challenge in a manufacturing environment geared primarily toward thermal chemistry. In this work, we present a versatile flow-based robotic platform to address these challenges through the integration of readily available hardware and custom software. Our open-source platform combines a liquid handler, syringe pumps, a tunable continuous-flow photoreactor, inexpensive Internet of Things devices, and an in-line benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer to enable automated, data-rich optimization with a closed-loop Bayesian optimization strategy. A user-friendly graphical interface allows chemists without programming or machine learning expertise to easily monitor, analyze, and improve photocatalytic reactions with respect to both continuous and discrete variables. The system's effectiveness was demonstrated by increasing overall reaction yields and improving space-time yields compared with those of previously reported processes.           ,              Editor's summary                            There has been an extraordinary burst of recent research in photochemistry and photocatalysis  driven in part by the environmentally benign appeal of light as a source of reactivity. However, many of the studies showcase small-scale reactions, and scale-up relies on a patchwork of different technologies that can require substantial trial and error to optimize. Slattery               et al               . report a combined software and hardware platform that iteratively determines optimal, substrate-specific conditions for photochemical processes in a scalable, flow-based architecture. The closed-loop Bayesian optimization approach enhances overall and space-time yields of a variety of distinct reactions. ---Jake S. Yeston                        ,              A combined software and hardware platform facilitates substrate-specific optimization of photochemical reactions.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Photocatalysis exploits light for driving reactivity under mild conditions, contributing to advancements in synthetic methods for pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. Nonetheless, challenges persist in optimizing, replicating, and scaling these techniques. These challenges stem from practical considerations such as uneven light absorption and experimental variability, alongside chemical complexities such as poorly understood reaction mechanisms and intricate interactions among various variables. These phases in advancing photocatalytic processes are crucial yet time-consuming components of contemporary chemical manufacturing, requiring expertise and precision owing to their intricate and sensitive nature.                                         RATIONALE               In response to the need for efficient optimization of complex photocatalytic reaction conditions, we have developed a robotic platform named RoboChem. RoboChem facilitates the self-optimization, intensification, and scale-up of photocatalytic transformations. By integrating readily available hardware, customized software, and a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm, this platform offers a hands-free and safe solution, mitigating associated challenges. Operating autonomously, RoboChem eliminates the requirement for extensive expertise in photocatalysis or scaling processes to achieve optimal results. This renders RoboChem a valuable collaborative robotic platform suitable for any synthetic organic chemistry laboratory, irrespective of users' specific familiarity with photocatalysis.                                         RESULTS               The robotic platform incorporates several key components, including a liquid handler, syringe pumps, a tunable continuous-flow photoreactor, cost-effective Internet of Things devices, and an in-line nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system. It uses a closed-loop BO approach to systematically explore a chosen parameter space encompassing both discrete and continuous variables. Consequently, the platform excels in identifying optimal reaction conditions that maximize either yield, throughput, or a combination thereof.               Operating within a continuous flow microreactor, the platform effectively addresses mass, heat, and photon transport considerations, resulting in the generation of well-structured datasets. These datasets capture both positive and negative results, thereby highlighting the influence of specific variables on the targeted objective function.               Furthermore, the optimal conditions identified by the platform have been successfully scaled up within the same continuous flow photoreactor. Manual isolation processes have been applied to obtain meaningful quantities of pure isolated compounds. Notably, the isolated yields closely align with the NMR yields obtained by the platform, validating its high precision and reliability.               The platform's capabilities were demonstrated across a diverse set of 19 molecules, covering various facets of photocatalysis, such as hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis, photoredox catalysis, and metallaphotocatalysis. Notably, human involvement was limited to the definition of the parametric space, the preparation of stock solutions and the isolation of pure compounds. The effectiveness of the platform stems from its BO algorithm, which efficiently captures intricate interdependencies among different reaction variables. Consequently, the platform consistently identified optimal reaction conditions that either matched or exceeded those obtained through manual approaches. As a result, the RoboChem platform stands out from conventional synthetic methods by tailoring reaction conditions to the specific needs of each substrate. This capability enables a thorough assessment of the applicability and limitations of the reported transformations, ultimately enhancing their value for potential industrial implementation.                                         CONCLUSION               The RoboChem robotic platform expedites and streamlines the optimization of photocatalytic transformations, simultaneously enhancing safety and liberating researchers to focus on other creative facets of chemistry.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               With limited agricultural land and increasing human population, it is essential to enhance overall photosynthesis and thus productivity. Oxygenic photosynthesis begins with light absorption, followed by excitation energy transfer to the reaction centres, primary photochemistry, electron and proton transport, NADPH and ATP synthesis, and then CO2 fixation (Calvin--Benson cycle, as well as Hatch--Slack cycle). Here we cover some of the discoveries related to this process, such as the existence of two light reactions and two photosystems connected by an electron transport `chain' (the Z-scheme), chemiosmotic hypothesis for ATP synthesis, water oxidation clock for oxygen evolution, steps for carbon fixation, and finally the diverse mechanisms of regulatory processes, such as `state transitions' and `non-photochemical quenching' of the excited state of chlorophyll a.                                         Scope               In this review, we emphasize that mathematical modelling is a highly valuable tool in understanding and making predictions regarding photosynthesis. Different mathematical models have been used to examine current theories on diverse photosynthetic processes; these have been validated through simulation(s) of available experimental data, such as chlorophyll a fluorescence induction, measured with fluorometers using continuous (or modulated) exciting light, and absorbance changes at 820 nm ({$\Delta$}A820) related to redox changes in P700, the reaction centre of photosystem I.                                         Conclusions               We highlight here the important role of modelling in deciphering and untangling complex photosynthesis processes taking place simultaneously, as well as in predicting possible ways to obtain higher biomass and productivity in plants, algae and cyanobacteria.},

  abstract = {Mapping gene networks requires large amounts of transcriptomic data to learn the connections between genes, which impedes discoveries in settings with limited data, including rare diseases and diseases affecting clinically inaccessible tissues. Recently, transfer learning has revolutionized fields such as natural language understanding1,2 and computer vision3 by leveraging deep learning models pretrained on large-scale general datasets that can then be fine-tuned towards a vast array of downstream tasks with limited task-specific data. Here, we developed a context-aware, attention-based deep learning model, Geneformer, pretrained on a large-scale corpus of about 30\,million single-cell transcriptomes to enable context-specific predictions in settings with limited data in network biology. During pretraining, Geneformer gained a fundamental understanding of network dynamics, encoding network hierarchy in the attention weights of the model in a completely self-supervised manner. Fine-tuning towards a diverse panel of downstream tasks relevant to chromatin and network dynamics using limited task-specific data demonstrated that Geneformer consistently boosted predictive accuracy. Applied to disease modelling with limited patient data, Geneformer identified candidate therapeutic targets for cardiomyopathy. Overall, Geneformer represents a pretrained deep learning model from which fine-tuning towards a broad range of downstream applications can be pursued to accelerate discovery of key network regulators and candidate therapeutic targets.},

We identified systems with specific molecular composition and were able to characterize essential parameters of MD simulation such as temperature and simulation length, and could identify model resolution, such as all-atom and coarse-grain. Based on this analysis, we inferred metadata to propose a search engine prototype to explore the MD data. To continue in this direction, we call on the community to pursue the effort of sharing MD data, and to report and standardize metadata to reuse this valuable matter.},

Protected areas, with their long-term institutional mandate for biodiversity conservation, play an important role as data providers, for example, through the long-term monitoring of natural resources. However, poor data management often limits the use and reuse of this wealth of information. In this paper, we share lessons learned in managing long-term data from the Italian Alpine national parks. Our analysis and examples focus on specific issues faced by managers of protected areas, which partially differ from those faced by academic researchers, predominantly owing to different mission, governance, and temporal perspectives. Rigorous data quality control, the use of appropriate data management tools, and acquisition of the necessary skills remain the main obstacles. Common protocols for data collection offer great opportunities for the future, and complete recovery and documentation of time series is an urgent priority. Notably, before data can be shared, protected areas should improve their data management systems, a task that can be achieved only with adequate resources and a long-term vision. We suggest strategies that protected areas, funding agencies, and the scientific community can embrace to address these problems. The added value of our work lies in promoting engagement with managers of protected areas and in reporting and analysing their concrete requirements and problems, thereby contributing to the ongoing discussion on data management and sharing through a bottom-up approach.},

  abstract = {Digital Twins of the Ocean (DTO) are a rapidly emerging topic that has attracted significant interest from scientists in recent years. The initiative, strongly driven by the EU, aims to create a digital replica of the ocean to better understand and manage marine environments. The Iliad project, funded under the EU Green Deal call, is developing a framework to support multiple interoperable DTO using a federated systems-of-systems approach across various fields of applications and ocean areas, called pilots. This paper presents the results of a Water Quality DTO pilot located in the Trondheim fjord in Norway. This paper details the building blocks of DTO, specific to this environmental monitoring pilot. A crucial aspect of any DTO is data, which can be sourced internally, externally, or through a hybrid approach utilizing both. To realistically twin ocean processes, the Water Quality pilot acquires data from both surface and benthic observatories, as well as from mobile sensor platforms for on-demand data collection. Data ingested into an InfluxDB are made available to users via an API or an interface for interacting with the DTO and setting up alerts or events to support 'what-if' scenarios. Grafana, an interactive visualization application, is used to visualize and interact with not only time-series data but also more complex data such as video streams, maps, and embedded applications. An additional visualization approach leverages game technology based on Unity and Cesium, utilizing their advanced rendering capabilities and physical computations to integrate and dynamically render real-time data from the pilot and diverse sources. This paper includes two case studies that illustrate the use of particle sensors to detect microplastics and monitor algae blooms in the fjord. Numerical models for particle fate and transport, OpenDrift and DREAM, are used to forecast the evolution of these events, simulating the distribution of observed plankton and microplastics during the forecasting period.},

To approach the latter, we systematically determined and characterized light-environmental effects on thylakoid ion transport-mediated short-term responses during light fluctuations.

For a detailed characterization of selected light conditions, we monitored ion flux dynamics at unprecedented high temporal resolution by a modified spectroscopy approach.                                                                        Our analyses reveal that daily light intensity sculpts photosynthetic capacity as a main acclimatory driver with positive and negative effects on the function of KEA3 and VCCN1 during high-light phases, respectively. Fluctuations in light intensity boost the accumulation of the photoprotective pigment zeaxanthin (Zx). We show that KEA3 suppresses Zx accumulation during the day, which together with its direct proton transport activity accelerates photosynthetic transition to lower light intensities.                                                     In summary, both light-environment factors, intensity and variability, modulate the function of thylakoid ion transport in dynamic photosynthesis with distinct effects on lumen pH, Zx accumulation, photoprotection, and photosynthetic efficiency.},

Taking a step further, we capture the operational and manufacturing carbon footprint of AI computing and present an end-to-end analysis for what and how hardware-software design and at-scale optimization can help reduce the overall carbon footprint of AI. Based on the industry experience and lessons learned, we share the key challenges and chart out important development directions across the many dimensions of AI.

  abstract = {Abstract             Ecosystem functions and services are severely threatened by unprecedented global loss in biodiversity. To counteract these trends, it is essential to develop systems to monitor changes in biodiversity for planning, evaluating, and implementing conservation and mitigation actions. However, the implementation of monitoring systems suffers from a trade-off between grain (i.e., the level of detail), extent (i.e., the number of study sites), and temporal repetition. Here, we present an applied and realized networked sensor system for integrated biodiversity monitoring in the Nature 4.0 project as a solution to these challenges, which considers plants and animals not only as targets of investigation, but also as parts of the modular sensor network by carrying sensors. Our networked sensor system consists of three main closely interlinked components with a modular structure: sensors, data transmission, and data storage, which are integrated into pipelines for automated biodiversity monitoring. We present our own real-world examples of applications, share our experiences in operating them, and provide our collected open data. Our flexible, low-cost, and open-source solutions can be applied for monitoring individual and multiple terrestrial plants and animals as well as their interactions. Ultimately, our system can also be applied to area-wide ecosystem mapping tasks, thereby providing an exemplary cost-efficient and powerful solution for biodiversity monitoring. Building upon our experiences in the Nature 4.0 project, we identified ten key challenges that need to be addressed to better understand and counteract the ongoing loss of biodiversity using networked sensor systems. To tackle these challenges, interdisciplinary collaboration, additional research, and practical solutions are necessary to enhance the capability and applicability of networked sensor systems for researchers and practitioners, ultimately further helping to ensure the sustainable management of ecosystems and the provision of ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTPhotosynthesis is arguably the most researched of all plant processes. A dynamic model of leaf photosynthesis that includes each discrete process from light capture to carbohydrate synthesis,e-photosynthesis, is described. It was developed by linking and extending our previous models of photosystem II (PSII) energy transfer and photosynthetic C3 carbon metabolism to include electron transfer processes around photosystem I (PSI), ion transfer between the lumen and stroma, ATP synthesis and NADP reduction to provide a complete representation. Different regulatory processes linking the light and dark reactions are also included: Rubisco activation via Rubisco activase, pH and xanthophyll cycle-dependent non-photochemical quenching mechanisms, as well as the regulation of enzyme activities via the ferredoxin-theoredoxin system. Although many further feedback and feedforward controls undoubtedly exist, it is shown thate-photosynthesis effectively mimics the typical kinetics of leaf CO2uptake, O2evolution, chlorophyll fluorescence emission, lumen and stromal pH, and membrane potential following perturbations in light, [CO2] and [O2] observed in intact C3 leaves. The model provides a framework for guiding engineering of improved photosynthetic efficiency, for evaluating multiple non-invasive measures used in emerging phenomics facilities, and for quantitative assessment of strengths and weaknesses within the understanding of photosynthesis as an integrated process.},
