Models of photosynthesis are a popular part of modern science. They have been used in many different ways, where several models have been developed to simulate various aspects of photosynthesis differently. There are so many in fact, that finding the right one for a specific application can be daunting, especially for newcomers to the field. This is where the \greensloth{} project comes into play, taking inspiration from existing tools and frameworks to provide a unified, user-friendly interface to work with photosynthesis models, that facilitates the bridge between model developers and users.

To further enhance this goal, future work on \greensloth{} includes expanding the library of models available, improving the tool by using community feedback, employing experts of web development to create a polished web application, and create a network of specialized \gls{ai} agents to assist users and help developers in their respective endeavors. With these improvements, \greensloth{} aims to become the go-to platform for anyone interested in working with and creating photosynthesis models.
